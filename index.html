                <h3>About The Hadassah House</h3>
                <p>
                    At The Hadassah House, we believe learning should feel like exploration, not a one-size-fits-all checklist. Nestled in the heart of Baker, Florida, our small, family-run microschool welcomes up to 8 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, creating a warm, multi-age community where older children naturally mentor younger ones and every child is truly known. As a homeschool cooperative supported by Florida’s Personalized Education Program (PEP) scholarships, we keep tuition affordable while delivering a rich, personalized education in a safe home setting. We meet four days a week for short, focused sessions that leave afternoons free for family time, outdoor play, and real-life learning. Our name, The Hadassah House, is inspired by Queen Esther's original Jewish name, Hadassah—the season of quiet preparation before she became queen and, with courage and wisdom, saved her people at just the right moment. We envision this microschool as that same kind of nurturing preparation ground: equipping young minds with the knowledge, skills, confidence, and character they need to step boldly into their futures, ready to make meaningful differences and fulfill their unique purposes. "...For such a time as this."

                    We dive into science with thematic unit studies that unite every age around one captivating topic—like marine biology, bugs, decomposition, or ecosystems—with hands-on experiments, outdoor adventures, and age-appropriate materials that let younger children play and draw while older students research and analyze. 
                <br>
                    English Language Arts builds on the trusted Essentials in Writing (EIW) program, supplemented by creative, teacher-designed assignments to nurture confident readers and writers.

                    Social studies and history unfold through quality books, enriched with exciting cultural projects and multi-age hands-on activities that make the past feel alive. 
                <br>
                <hr>
                    Woven throughout our days are meaningful explorations of life skills—learning to care for ourselves and our spaces, building independence, mastering practical fundamentals like cooking, budgeting, organization, and self-reliance—so students grow not just academically, but as capable, confident individuals ready for the real world. We weave in technology wisely—videos and tablets support certain lessons, while others emphasize books, worksheets, projects, and direct teacher instruction—moving seamlessly between group collaboration and individual age-appropriate work, indoors and out in the fresh Florida air.
